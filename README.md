# Supervised Learning on Breast Cancer Dataset

This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques on the breast cancer dataset from sklearn. We implemented and compared five different classification algorithms to evaluate their performance on this dataset.

## Objective
Evaluate understanding and application of supervised learning techniques using a real-world dataset.

## Dataset
Breast cancer dataset from sklearn, containing 569 instances with 30 features.

## Key Components

1. **Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values (none found) and performed feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Classification Algorithms**
   - Implemented: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, k-NN.

3. **Model Comparison**
   - Compared performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Best model: Random Forest
   - Worst model: Decision Tree
