# Supervised Learning on Breast Cancer Dataset

## Objective
Evaluate understanding and application of supervised learning techniques using a real-world dataset.

## Dataset
Breast cancer dataset from sklearn, containing 569 instances with 30 features.

## Key Components

1. **Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values (none found) and performed feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Classification Algorithms**
   - Implemented: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, k-NN.

3. **Model Comparison**
 We evaluate each model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compared performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Best model: Random Forest
   - Worst model: Decision Tree
**Conclusion:** All models performed well. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM achieved perfect scores, making them the top choices. k-NN performed slightly lower but was still effective.
